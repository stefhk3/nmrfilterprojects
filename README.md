# nmrfilterprojects

This is a collection of data to be used by the [nmrfilter](https://github.com/stefhk3/nmrfilter) project. The data are organized into folders, called "projects". When nmrfilter is run for one project, it analyses the mixture in that project.

For example, running

`nmrfilter.sh artificial'

uses the data in the project/folder "artificial". See the [README]([https://github.com/stefhk3/nmrfilter](https://github.com/stefhk3/nmrfilter/blob/master/README.md) in nmrfilter for more details
